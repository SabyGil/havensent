              Hi {this.props.haven.title} Administrators/Staff,
              <br/>
              <br/>
              My family and I have benefited from {this.props.haven.title}â€™s mission, and we are thankful for your dedication. However, we now need help with these services, you need {this.props.requestedResources.map(i=>i.title)}. We strongly urge you to reach out to other organizations to provide these services for us so that we can continue to support {this.props.haven.title}.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Thank you.
