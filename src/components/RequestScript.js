              Hi [Name of Haven] Administrators/Staff,
              <br/>
              <br/>
              My family and I have benefited from [Name of Haven]â€™s mission, and we are thankful for your dedication. However, we now need help with [service you need 1], [service you need 2], [service you need 3]. We strongly urge you to reach out to other organizations to provide these services for us so that we can continue to support [Name of Haven].
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Thank you.
